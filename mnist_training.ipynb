    "This project was created to study *deep learning* and their concepts. The principal ideia is to build a simple neural network to perform image classification on **[MNIST handwritten digits dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)**. The **[Keras API](https://keras.io/)** is used to load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training.\n",

    "> MNIST is an acronym that stands for the *Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology*.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, its necessary to know the difference between *traditional programming* and *machine learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional programming, the programmer is able to articulate rules and conditions in their code that their program can then use to act in the correct way. This approach continues to work exceptionally well for a huge variety of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification, which asks a program to correctly classify an image it has never seen before into its correct class, is near impossible to solve with traditional programming techniques. Because of this, *deep learning* became a better solution to this. By training a deep neural network with sufficient data, and providing the network with feedback on its performance via training, the network can identify, though a huge amount of iteration, its own set of conditions by which it can act in the correct way.\n",
